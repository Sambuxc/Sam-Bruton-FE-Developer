### Hi there 👋

**sambuxc/sam-bruton-FE-developer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ personal repo portfolio as a Frontend web developer in Northwest England.

:bowtie: :computer:

- 🔭  Expanding my skills in Vue js
- 🪨  6 years of solid Frontend experience developing custom themes on Shopify & Wordpress

#### How did I get into Web Dev?

I saw a niche market in a multi-massive online chatting community (MMOCC) game called Habbo Hotel in the early 2000s and decided to create fansites for myself and other players. I designed, coded and hosted their websites and provided shoutcast radios so that visitors could enjoy music whilst exploring webpage content.

#### What is the most important thing to me?

Simplification, Fun, Helping others and Skating.
